# CSC 245 - Data Structures
#### Instructor: Tristan A. Hearn, Ph.D.
#### Email: thearn@bw.edu
#### Time/Room: MWF 1:00-1:50/MACS 183
#### Final Exam time/date: Wednesday, Dec 6, 11:30am-2:30pm


## Scope

This is a fundamental course that will cover a collection of topics that naturally follow an introductory course in computer science and programming. Primary among these are the selection, implementation, and utilization of several common programming data structures:

- Static and dynamic arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary search trees
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Hash tables

In addition to both a high-level and practical study of data structures, this course will introduce:

* Programming in Java
* Basics of Object-Oriented programming (OOP)
* Performance ("Big-O") analysis for common operations on data structures
* Unit testing and test-driven development

The student is expected to significantly elevate his or her programming skills during this class so that in future computer science courses, programming can be viewed as a tool rather than the main focus of study. Students are also challenged to explore the impact of data modeling on the power and efficiency of the programs they write.

## Coursework
There will be three categories of graded work that will count towards your final course grade.
The description and weighting of each of these is as follows:

- #### **Programming Assignments**   50%
    These will be announced, distributed, and returned as zipped-up Java project directories. They will be graded by automated unit tests as well as manual review. Printed copies will be returned with my written comments.
- #### **Exams**                     30%
    There will be two non-comprehensive in-class closed-book exams during the semester. The exams will focus more on high-level concepts covered in this course.
- #### **Final Exam**                20%
     A comprehensive final exam administered during final exam week.


## Textbooks required:
- (None)

To be honest, the topics in this course are widely discussed in a variety of free sources available over the Internet, and I really can't justify requiring the purchase of a print text.

In fact, [googling "data structures in java"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=data+structures+in+java) will point you materials that discuss a lot of the content that we'll cover in this course. Some of what you'll find covers it really well, some of it not so well, but it's all out there in the uncurated ether that is the Internet.

Throughout the course I will instead be sharing all of my course notes with you just like I am here, which can  be used as an immediate reference. I'll also share web resources that I find convenient for me throughout the semester. For now, I'd recommend at least bookmarking [the official Oracle documentation for Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/).

### Optional Reference Textbooks:

There a couple texts that I would recommend as desk resources, if you'd like to keep some printed material on-hand either for this course or for general future reference:

- [**Data Structures & Other Objects Using JAVA, by Michael Main**](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Other-Objects-Using/dp/0132576244) has been used as a course textbook for CSC 245 @ BW in the past, and has been recommended as a good Java-specific reference for the topics covered in this course.

- [**Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein**](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) aka **"CLRS"**, this is considered the go-to reference for undergraduate-level data structures and algorithms theory. A high-level book that is non-programming language specific, but it can be pretty notationally complex is some places. 

- [**Algorithms, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne**](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X) Another text considered to be a standard reference for data structures and algorithms. A bit more practical and easier to read cover-to-cover than CLRS, but not as comprehensive in its scope.

- [**The Algorithm Design Manual, by Steven Skiena**](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693) A very practically minded and also widely recommended resource on data structures and algorithms. I often see it listed for software developer interview preparation and as a periodic theory refresher for software professionals.

<!-- ```java
class HelloWorld
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }


``` -->

## Software required

There are a few programs that you'll need to install for the course, all of which are free to download and install:

- [**Oracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK), version 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html): This installer includes everything thing to both run and program in Java **version 8**. The site includes installers and instructions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms.

- [**IntelliJ IDEA, CE**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/): This is the Java programming integrated development environment (IDE) that I will use in the classroom. It's pretty friendly to use, and the **free community edition (CE)** has more than enough for mainstream Java development.

- [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com): I'll use the file sync service Dropbox to distribute various course files and collect assignments for the course, while all grade information will be kept on Blackboard. The amount of data that will be shared over the length if the course is small enough that the free 2GB tier of the service will be good enough, if you don't already have an account. There are actually a few file sync and sharing services out there that work really well. The key thing about Dropbox for me is that it has a working Linux client. If you really, really, really want to use Google Drive or something else to send files to me instead, send me a message and we can figure something out.

---------------------

## Expectations of student participation and responsibility:

- **Academic honesty:** In order to succeed in this course, it is imperative that a student produce all of his/her own work independently unless otherwise instructed. Collaboration on any activity, including written homework and programming assignments, will be treated as the serious offense that it is. Baldwin Wallace University has an academic honesty policy in effect (see [Policy on Academic Honesty](https://www.bw.edu/Assets/Academics/Dept-Communication-Sciences-Disorders-Student-Handbook.pdf)). In the event of violation of this policy, the procedures prescribed by the policy will be followed. It must be emphasized that in a programming related course, plagiarism also includes "writing programs together." Programming styles become very distinctive as programs get larger and programmers mature in the discipline. It would be virtually impossible for two people to sit down separately and produce, line for line, equivalent programs. Thus, as part of the grading process, code for each program will be examined. Striking similarities in the code of two or more programs will be scrutinized and pursued as potential plagiarism.

- **Late Policy:** Late assignments will incur a penalty of 10% of the maximum point value per weekday (i.e., a program due on Monday that is submitted on Friday will incur a 40% late penalty) with no assignments accepted beyond 5 weekdays of the announced due date. NO EXCEPTIONS.

- **Makeup Policy:** Makeup exams will be given at the discretion of the instructor. If you find that you must miss an exam for some reason, contact the instructor as soon as possible before the scheduled time. Use the office phone number provided and leave voice mail if necessary. The instructor reserves the right to request verification of the circumstances causing a student to miss a scheduled exam.

- **Final Exam Policy:** In accordance with the policies of Baldwin Wallace University, all final exams are given during final exam week and at the pre-scheduled time. The date/time of the final exam for this course is indicated at the top of this syllabus. The final exam may only be rescheduled if a student has three or more finals on the same day. No other reason for rescheduling will be acceptable. If a student does plan to reschedule his/her final, he/she must contact the Academic Dean's office at the beginning of the semester to make the arrangements.

- **Attendance Policy:** In accordance with university policy, attendance at all classes is mandatory. Students may be excused from a class only with notification of the instructor prior to class and upon the production of a written, verifiable excuse (e.g., attendance at a scheduled university activity, serious illness, death in family, etc.). Due dates of assignments are NOT extended because of absence.

- **Out of class instructor assistance:** Students are encouraged to meet with the instructor outside of class to ask questions and seek clarification on course material and assignments. Before seeking help on an assignment, a student should have made an honest effort to solve his/her problem independently. Any meeting with the instructor regarding an assignment-related question will begin with the question "What have you tried so far and what insight did it give you?". If a student comes for help without having put effort into solving his/her own problem, the instructor will make suggestions as to how he/she might start looking for a solution, but will not simply solve the problem for the student. Documenting what approaches have been tried and their results would be helpful in facilitating the kind of instructor/student interaction in these circumstances that will ultimately result in students being better able to solve problems independently.
