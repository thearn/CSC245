This is meant to be a very short non-comprehensive primer on basic types and syntax of the Java language. It is assumed that all students have some familiarity with these concepts from earlier coursework in other languages.

# Primitive (value) data types

The Java language supports the common data types that you would expect to find in most programming languages. These are sometimes referred to as "value types". They are all pre-defined as keywords in the language, and store values directly (which contrast with object types, which store values to references in memory). The primitive types in Java are:

- boolean
- byte
- short
- char
- int
- long
- float
- double

Short examples of the more commonly used primitive types are given below.

-------------------------------

### *int*
The integer or `int` data type is used to store whole numbers between $-2^{31}$ and $2^{32} - 1$.

**Example:**

```java
// int stores a positive or negative whole number
int x = 3;

// this will result in a value of 1, not 1.5
int y = x / 2;

// printing out an integer
System.out.println(x);
```

-------------------------------
### *long*

A `long` is used to represent whole numbers in the range $-2^{64}$ and $2^{64} - 1$.

`long`s can represent much larger integer values than `int`, but will use more memory. `int` is generally more appropriate for integers whose range is reasonably bounded (like as iteration indices over arrays, etc.) while `long`s are more appropriate for numerical computing with whole numbers (particularly for number theory).

```java
int number = 2147483649; // will not compile, number is too large for int

// long will work though
// long values literals are written as integers, but with a capital "L" after the last digit
long number = 2147483649L;
```

-------------------------------
### *double*
The `double` data type stores a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number. Generally you use this to represent non-integer numerical values.

**Example:**

```java
// int stores a positive or negative decimal number
double pi = 3.1415;

// you can use scientific notation as well as decimal input
double small = -1.2e-15;

// printing out a double
System.out.println(pi);
```
-------------------------------

### *boolean*
The `boolean` data type is used to store either `true` or `false`. Used for conditional expressions and many other purposes where you want to limit a variable to two states.

**Example:**

```java
// boolean stores either true or false
boolean x = true;

// we can use boolean operations to transform them
boolean y = !x;      // will be `false`
boolean z = x || y;  // x OR y
boolean w = x && y;  // x AND y

// printing out a boolean
System.out.println(x);
```
-------------------------------

### *char*
A `char` is used to represent a single text character.
`char` literals are specified using singe quotes, `'`.

**Example:**

```java
// can store a single letter, number, or any unicode character as text.
char letter = 'a';
char my_number = '4';

// printing out a char
System.out.println(letter);
```

-------------------------

# Reference data types

In contrast to primitive data types, reference types in Java do not store values directly, but rather store locations in memory where values can be accessed.

Every variable that is not a primitive data type is a reference data type, including arrays and objects.

### *Arrays*

An array is a collection of data stored contiguously in memory. An array can be used to store any of the previously listed data types, as well as more complex objects that we will see later.

Elements of a populated array can be accessed by an integer index representing that elements place within the array. All array indices in Java begin from 0.

An array of any data type can be declared by following the type name with `[]`.

**Example:**

```java
// declaring and creating an array of integers in one line
int x[] = {0,1,2,3};

// you can also split declaration from actually creating and populating the array
double numbers[]; // creates a reference
numbers = new double[3]; // sets the reference to an empty array of three doubles
numbers[0] = 0.2;        // first element
numbers[1] = -1.56787;   // second element
numbers[2] = 1e21;       // third element

// printing out an array - use the Array class (see below)
```

Arrays can be created with more than one dimension. For example, I can store a 2-by-2 array of integers as:

```java
int[][] matrix = new int[2][2];
matrix = {{1, 2},
          {3, 4}}
```

--------------------------------------

### *null*
This is a natural type to start with when discussing objects. In fact, the **null** data type can be considered to be the default value of any object that has been declared, but not initialized. Attempting to do most operations with an object that has a *null* value will result in an error known as a `NullPointerException`. We'll come across these in due time.

For now, you can think of the purpose of the *null* type and the `NullPointerException` error is to bring to our attention a situation where something in our program was not properly initialized, and they perform this job very well.

----------------------------

## Other built-in object data types and utilities

### *Arrays (class)*
The `Arrays` utility class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as printing, sorting, and searching).

**Example:**

```java
// an array of integers
int x[] = {0,1,2,3};

// can print this out with the Arrays.toString method
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(x));

int[] y = {5, 6, -2, 102};
// Arrays.equals if two arrays contain the same data
boolean z = Arrays.equals(x,y);

```


### *String*
`String` objects represent an immutable collection of characters. Used to process words, sentences, and other streams of data.

**Example:**

```java
String text = "hello world";
// can produce a char array version of any string
char[] letters = text.toCharArray();

// can split a string into an array of strings based on a pattern
String[] split = text.split(" "); // splits on the space to give a string array {"hello", "world"}

// can check if a string contains a character or a specific word
boolean has_z = text.contains("z");
```
----------------------------

## Values vs. references: a closer look

It's worth another careful look at the difference between primitive and reference types, and what happens in memory when they are created and passed around.

When I create a variable such as `int x = 0;` a small portion of memory is set aside in **stack** memory for `x` that contains a value of 0. When the current running method is exited, this memory location and value are removed and made available to be overwritten.

In contrast, when I create a reference type, such as an array
`double[] x` or any object `Something x;`, there is a variable called `x` that is created on the stack like before, but it does not contain the value for `x`. Instead, what this location stores is a reference to another part of the program's memory called the **heap**. The location in the heap that `x` points to will contain the actual value for `x`.

The advantage is that while stack frames come into and out of existence, **heap memory is persistent**. That means that the actual data for reference types does not need to be passed around and re-created in each stack frame, we just need to pass around the *location* to the relevant data. We call these passed-around memory locations *references* (some languages have an analogous concept called *pointers*).

For example, while we haven't talked about object-oriented programming yet, let's define a really simple object type (using a class), for a quick example of the above:

```java
class myData {
    int value;
}
```

We can create variables of this type:

```java
myData data;
```

As soon as we declare this, a spot in stack memory is set aside that will contain the memory location where the *actual* data will live, once we actually create an instance of the `myData` class for `data` to store.
Until we do that, `data` actually points to a value of `null` in the heap!

Now, we can assign a value
```java
data = new myData();
data.value = 5;
```

and everything is initialized. `data` now points to a location in heap memory that stores actual values.

The thing is that we can re-assign it at any point to a new instance of myData and start over if we wanted:

```java
data = new myData();
```

if we inspected the actual heap memory location where `data` points to, it would be different. So what happened to the one in the old location?
The JVM garbage collector will automatically reclaim that memory if nothing else in the program points to it.

This is an interesting dynamic that we can directly make use of later in the course. The most immediate thing is it gives us the ability to directly modify an object or array by calling a method, without needed to have a return type. For example, if we had a method that took in our class and added 5 to the value field:

```java
public static void add_five(myData stuff) {
    stuff.value += 5;
}
```

This would actually modify the original instance that it was called with

```java
myData x = new myData();
x.value = 0;

System.out.println(x.value) // would print 0

add_five(x);

System.out.println(x.value) // would print 5!
```

This can be very convenient, especially for array processing. But I won't always make use of this behavior in every context.

----------------------------

# Flow control

Java contains has program flow control syntax that is common to many other languages, such as C, C++, etc.

### "For" loops
A for-loop specifies a specific range of iteration.

**Example: Print out all whole numbers from 0 to 100**
```java
// can easily use an integer iteration variable for this
for (int i=0; i <= 100; i++) {
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

Java 8 also provides simple ways to iterate over the elements of an array or other "linear" data structures (more on this later).

**Example: print out the length of each word of the phrase "iteration is pretty fun"**

```java
// make our sentence, then separate the words automatically as an array
String some_text = "iteration is pretty fun";
String[] separate_words = some_text.split(" ");

// we can iterate over this an operate on each word without using an index variable if we want
// you would read this out loud as "for each String 'word' in separate_words, do this.."

for (String word : separate_words) {
    System.out.println(word.length());
}
```

### "While" loops

A "While" loop continues iterating over a block of code until a condition is met.

**Example: Find the smallest number that is larger than one million, and divisible by both 123 and 42 (answer: 1000482).**

```java
// well, we might as well start at one million
int i = 1000000;

// while not divisible by 123, or not divisible by 42, keep incrementing it until it is
while ((i % 123 !=0) || (i % 42 !=0)) {
    i++;
};

// when the while loop stops, 'i' will be at the value we're looking for
System.out.println(i);
```

### Conditionals

A conditional statement determines whether a block of code will be executed or not based on a boolean value.

**Example: For each whole number from 1 to 100: if the number is a multiple of three, print "Fizz". If it's a multiple of 5, print "buzz", if its a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz". Otherwise, just print the number.**

```java
// classic "fizzbuzz" exercise
// can be made more efficient!
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

    if ((i % 3==0) && (i % 5==0)) {
        System.out.println("fizzbuzz");
    }

    else if (i % 3 == 0) {
        System.out.println("fizz");
    }

    else if (i % 5 == 0) {
        System.out.println("buzz");
    }

    else {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
