When writing a class in Java, there are a number of mechanisms that we can employ to more carefully control the accessibility of data members and methods of a class to the rest of the classes within our program.

In a large-scale, multi-developer project, this can help protect the integrity of the objects that represent our program's state.

They reserved keywords within the Java language that let us accomplish this kind of control are:

- *public*:

    - A *public* data member or method will be accessible to all other classes in a program.
    So far, we've been using this as the default for data members and methods.


- *private*:

    - A *private* data member or method is only accessible to other methods within the same class. For example, consider a modification to our `Circle` class:

    ```java
    public class Circle {
        // radius will not be directly accessible 
        private radius;

        //... (everything else stays the same)
    }
    ```
    With this change to `Circle`, we'd get:
    ```java
    Circle a = new Circle(2.3, {0,0});
    Double r = a.radius; // this would work before, but now will error
    ```

- *protected*:

    - A *protected* data member or method is accessible to other classes within the same package and to subclasses, but not any other classes.

- *final*:

    - Any variable declared *final* cannot have its value changed after initialization.

    - Any class method declared *final* cannot be overridden by a subclass.

    - Think of them as constants

    ```java
    public class Universe {
        // I don't think this will be changing
        // setting this as final will prevent it from
        // being reset, both within and outside of the class
        final int speed_light_in_vacuum = 299792458;
        // ...
    }
    ```
- *static*:

    - A data member or method declared *static* means that they are not connected to the existence of a instance of a class, and can be used by another class directly. For example, consider the class

    ```java
    public class Util {
        public static double pi = 3.14;
        public static double squared(double x) {
            return x * x;
        }
    }
    ```
    We can then use the static elements of the `Util` class without creating an instance of `Util`:
    
    ```java
        Double value = Util.pi;
        Double y = Util.squared(2.0);
    ```
    You can use this, for example, to create and organize stand-alone utility functions and reference data.

    From a memory point of view, static data is interesting in that if I have multiple instances of a single object type that has static data within the class definition, the static data is only allocated once on the heap, and then shared among all instances.
