# Dynamic arrays and the list ADT

At this point, we begin the discussion of data structures proper.

So far the only data structure that we have used is the basic typed array, such
as `int[]`, `String[]`, etc. Arrays are a fundamental structure that exist in the
core of every computing language, and do have some great properties.

When comparing between data structures, it's usually informative to first list
the type of operations that you would like to do with them. Across the board,
there are several operations that we can consider:

> ### Common data structure operations:
> - *Access* : Reading a specific element from the data structure by location
>
>- *Search* : Locating a specific element from the data structure by value
>
>- *Insertion* : Adding a new element to the data structure at a specific place (or wherever allowed).
>
>- *Deletion* : Removing an existing element from a data structure

Consider what these operations look like for the basic typed arrays that we have been using

#### Array access operation:

Arrays are great because we can access any location in the array by index directly. For example, if `x` is an array, we know that we can get the 3rd element of `x` by accessing `x[2]`. Behind the scenes, arrays are represented by a contiguous block of memory, so the accessed locations are fixed offsets from the starting value.

This means that the array access operation is actually independent of the size of the array itself, **and is therefore an** $\mathcal{O}(1)$ **operation.**

#### Array search operation:

For search, we're looking to find a location in an array where the value is equal to some specified search value. For instance, if we want to find the word "cat" in an array `String[] words` (with no additional assumptions), then we would have to potentially look at every element in the array for a match. A method for doing this would look like:

```java
public int search(String value, String[] words) {
    // search for a value in an array, return its location
    for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].equals(value)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

We saw this before in the discussion on [Big-O notation](big_o.html), and that this was an operation with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (i.e. linear) complexity. Therefore, the search operation for arrays is $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

#### Array insertion operation:

For arrays, this is where things can get tricky. One hand, setting a value in an array is pretty simply.
For example, if I want to fill up an integer array with a few values, all I have to do to get started is:

```java
int[] x = new int[3];
x[0] = 2;
x[1] = -1;
x[2] = 10;
```

and the array is filled. But what if I wanted to add in a new number (say, a 5) in the second spot, between the 2 and the -1 elements (shifting them to new places)? 

Arrays actually do not support this kind of operation directly, but we can get around this by creating a new array to replace the existing one. So array insertion generally requires that a larger array be created, and the existing elements copied over:

```java
int[] temp = new int[10]; // extra space, because why not
// move things into the new array, make space for our new value
temp[0] = x[0]
temp[1] = 5 // new number in the 2nd place
// copy the rest
for (int i = 2; i < x.length; i++) {
    temp[i] = x[i];
}

// re-assign reference, we can now use `x` again
x = temp;
```

This is a bit of a pain, but it's the best that can be done with arrays directly: re-size them if needed. Since the re-size operations involves copying all values of the existing array over, Array insertion is considered an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ operation. 

#### Array deletion operation

So if the array `x` has elements `{2, 5, -1, 10, ...}`, deletion would be the operation
to remove one of them from the array, an shift the remaining elements to fill its place. This is similair to the insertion operation, in that it will involve 
creating a temporary array and copying over the remaining elements, a $\mathcal{O}(n)$ procedure overall.

## The List ADT

As seen above, it is possible to define convenience operations around basic 
arrays to make them a bit more dynamic. More generally speaking, it is convenient 
to have access to a 1-dimensional array-like data structure that can support things 
like adding values, removing them, searching for them, and changing them on the fly, as part of the basic functionality of the structure itself. This abstract 
notion of a data structure (our wishlist above), is known as a **List**.

Java has a collection of List implementations that are ready to use, but we will explore the topic by first creating our own example implementations. 

A data structure that calls itself a list will generally support these operations:

- `List()` : a constructor for creating an empty list
- `boolean isEmpty()` : an operation for testing whether or not a list is empty
- `void add(Object value, int index)` : adds an element to a list at a specific index. If no index is given, add it at the end of the list.
- `void get(int index)` : an operation for getting the value of an element at a specific place in the list
- `void set(int index, Object value)` : an operation for setting the value of an entity
- `void remove(int index)` : an operation for removing an entity from a list at a specific position

Before exploring how to create something like this, we can make an `interface` to list what it is that we'd like a List to do.

```java
public interface IList<T> {
    public boolean isEmpty();
    public void add(T value);
    public T get(int index);
    public int size();
    public void set(T value, int index);
    public void remove(int index);
}
```

Note that this interface generalized the kind of values that it will store using the generic indicator `T`. A class that implements this interface may create these methods to store integers, doubles, Strings, or any other object. 

Let's implement this to create a list data structure that accepts `long`s:

The full implementation of `LongArrayList` is:

```java
public class LongArrayList implements IList<Long> {

    public long[] data = new long[5];
    public int length = 0;

    @Override
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        if (length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void add(Long value) {
        // adds value to the end of the list
        data[length] = value;
        length++;

        // resize, copy over data
        if (length >= data.length) {
            long[] temp = new long[data.length*2];
            for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
                temp[i] = data[i];
            }
            data = temp;
        }

    }

    @Override
    public Long get(int index) {
        if (index >= length) {
            return data[length - 1];
        }

        return data[index];
    }

    @Override
    public void set(Long value, int index) {
        data[index] = value;
    }

    @Override
    public void remove(int index) {

        for (int i = index; i < length; i++) {
            data[i] = data[i + 1];
        }
        length += -1;
    }

    public String toString() {
        String output = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            output += Long.toString(data[i]) + " ";
        }
        return output;
    }

    public int size() {
        return length;
    }
```

### Example use: 


## Java's default implementation: *ArrayList*

Not surprisingly, dynamic arrays that expose a list type of interface are a very convenient data structure, and Java comes with it's own implementation of it.

To create one, we need to specify the data type that it will store using generics. 
So to create an `ArrayList` of doubles, we could write

```java
ArrayList<Double> data = new ArrayList<>();
```
Note that we had to specify the data type double using the object version `Double` rather than the primitive data type version `double`. That is a bit of an idiosyncrasy of generics in Java, but `Double`s will work fine. Note also that we don't have to declare the `Double` type on both sides of the declaration and assignment, it is inferred on the right hand side.

If you're like me, you probably prefer to declare the structure based on the interface that you are using, rather than the exact implementation (which will come in on the assignment side). What I mean is that I would likely write the above as 

```java
List<Double> data = new ArrayList<>();
```

`List` is actually an `interface`, and you can't create an instance of it directly. But what I'm saying here is that `data` will do the stuff that any `List` will do. And, separately, I am also saying that it will be an `ArrayList`. 

Why say that separately? Well there is actually more than one kind of list implementation. In the next section we'll talk about Linked Lists. It's entirely possible that we might want to do something like:

```java
// I know I want to work with data as a list
List<Double> data;

if (some_condition == true) {
    data = new ArrayList<>();
}
else {
    data = new LinkedList<>();
}
```

So I know I want to use a list, but I can make the decision about what the underlying implementation is later in the same program if I'd like.

Either way, once I have a list instance that I want, [it's very easy to use](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/List.html):

```java
data.add(0.52);
data.add(-1032.34);
data.remove(0); // remove first element

for (double value : data) {
    System.out.println(value);
}
...
```
