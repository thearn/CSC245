# Dynamic arrays and the list ADT

At this point, we begin the discussion of data structures proper.

So far the only data structure that we have used is the basic typed array, such
as `int[]`, `String[]`, etc. Arrays are a fundamental structure that exist in the
core of every computing language, and do have some great properties.

When comparing between data structures, it's usually informative to first list
the type of operations that you would like to do with them. Across the board,
there are several operations that we can consider:

> ### Common data structure operations:
> - *Access* : Reading a specific element from the data structure by location
>
>- *Search* : Locating a specific element from the data structure by value
>
>- *Insertion* : Adding a new element to the data structure
>
>- *Deletion* : Removing an existing element from a data structure

Consider what these operations look like for the basic typed arrays that we have been using

#### Array access operation:

Arrays are great because we can access any location in the array by index directly. For example, if `x` is an array, we know that we can get the 3rd element of `x` by accessing `x[2]`. Behind the scenes, arrays are represented by a contiguous block of memory, so the accessed locations are fixed offsets from the starting value.

This means that the array access operation is actually independent of the size of the array itself, **and is therefore an** $O\left(1\right)$ **operation.**

#### Array search operation:

For search, we're looking to find a location in an array where the value is equal to some specified search value. For instance, if we want to find the word "cat" in an array `String[] words` (with no additional assumptions), then we would have to potentially look at every element in the array for a match. A method for doing this would look like:

```java
public int search(String value, String[] words) {
    // search for a value in an array, return its location
    for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].equals(value)) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

We saw this before in the discussion on [Big-O notation](big_o.html), and that this was an operation with $O\left(n\right)$ (i.e. linear) complexity. Therefore, the search operation for arrays is $O\left(n\right)$.

#### Array insertion operation:

For arrays, this is where things can get tricky. One hand, setting a value in an array is pretty simply.
If I want to fill up an integer array with a few values, all I have to do to get started is:

```java
```

#### Array deletion operation:
