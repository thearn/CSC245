So far, we have considered linear data structures, where elements are stored in a sequential way with a fairly non-ambiguous notion of positional order (first element, second element, etc.). The rest of the course will cover non-linear data structures, where the iteration and ordering of elements by position can be a bit more complex.

I think the transition between the two halves is actually a good place to discuss a new type of abstract type, known as a **Map** (sometimes also referred to as a Dictionary or Associative Array).

## Map interface

In a Map, we can store and retrieve data as we can with any data structure. But unlike lists or arrays, we do not want to store or return by the *position* of the data, but rather through the use of a **key**. In other words, all elements within a map are referred to by a key rather than by an index.

To contrast more simply, in an array or list of strings, we could access a particular element by position:

```java
// get data from index
String x = data_array[2]; // array access

String x = data_list.get(2); // list access
```

But in a map, we associate the data that we want with a particular key:

```java
// setting data
data_map.put("name", "Tristan");
data_map.put("age", 34);

// retrieving data
String s = data_map.get("name");
int x = dat_map.get("age");

// later, I can update my age using the exact same call as above
data_map.put("age", 35);
```

This provides a tremendous amount of flexibility in creating data structures that support rich value-based setting and querying behavior.

It's important to note that in Java, `Map` is an interface that is implemented by a variety of different implemented data structures.

The first that we will cover is called a **Hash Table**.

## Hash Tables

Hash tables are one method for implementing a data structure that has a Map/Dictionary/Associative Array-type of interface. Hash tables store key-value pairs using a function that maps each key to a position within a data structure that actually contains the objects to be stored. This process is known as *hashing* the keys, and the function to perform this is called a [*"hash function"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).


We can summarize the Big-O performance of hash tables as:

> ### Complexity of hash table operations (average):
> - *Access* : Getting an element by key $\mathcal{O}(1)$
>
>- *Search* : Getting an element by a non-key value $\mathcal{O}(n)$
>
>- *Insertion* : Adding an element (key-value pair) $\mathcal{O}(1)$
>
>- *Deletion* : Removing an element by key $\mathcal{O}(1)$

Note that I listed this as *average* time complexity, i.e. asymptotic performance under the expectation of reasonably favorable scenarios (few hash collisions).
It's important to note that there are a lot of details that come into the practical performance of hash tables. Complexity of the hashing algorithm, how collisions are handled, locality/CPU cache friendliness, etc.

As such, hash tables are a very carefully optimized class of data structures.

### Java's *HashMap*

Java has a built-in implementation of the hash table data structure in the `HashMap` class. Like all implementations of the `Map` interface, `HashMap` uses generics to specify what type of key and what type of values it can store:

```java
// store data with strings as keys, and Circle() objects as values
Map<String, Circle> data = new HashMap<>();

// make and store one
data.put("first", new Circle(1.24));

// make and store separately
Circle second = new Circle(0.2);
data.put("second", second);

// retrieve by key

Circle x = data.get("first");
```

In this case, I used a string as the type for all keys. What kinds of objects can be used with `HashMap`? Any object can be used that implements `equals()` (a method of determining when two separate instances of your class are "equal") and `hashCode()` (a method to map instances of your class to an integer for use in a hash table) methods correctly [can be used as keys within an instance of `HashMap`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/generating-equals-and-hashcode.html).


### The rule of thumb that I would suggest for the use of hash tables:

Hash tables are a great choice if:

- I naturally want to associate a key to an object, based on the problem that I need to solve.

- The keys that I want to use are not already integers.

- I need quick lookups and accesses by key.

- I do not anticipate needed to iterate over the structure very often or at least not in any type of assumed order.
