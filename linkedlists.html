# Linked Lists
----------------

So far, we've seen that we can store a collection of data using array-backed data structures, such as ArrayLists. This has the advantage of having fast $\mathcal{O}(1)$ access to the elements of the list, though the cost of adding and removing elements is $\mathcal{O}(n)$, do to needing to re-allocate an array in order to resize it.

Aside from arrays, there is another implementation strategy for storing related collections of objects in memory, known as [linked data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data_structure). A strategy that can be used for the implementation of any ADT we have in mind, such as lists.

First, instead of conceptualizing our data as existing as elements within an array, we consider our data as existing as members within an object called a *node*. A node should contain variables that represent single instances of any data that you would like to store within your linked structure. In addition, a node will also contain a reference to **another** (possible multiple) nodes, though these will not be instantiated within the node class itself.

For example, if we'd like to store a collection of `double` variables within a linked data structure, we might create a node class such as:

```java
class Node {
    public double value = 0.0;
    public Node next;
}
```

We could then start the processes of storing some doubles by creating an instance of our node:

```java
Node start = new Node();
start.value = 3.14;
```

So we have access to one node that holds one value, nothing too exciting yet.
Next, we can create a second one, and **link** to it from the first:

```java
start.next = new Node();
start.next.value = 2.71;
```

![alt text](images/tikz/heap2.svg?style=tikz "")


This creates a new `Node()` in heap memory, and links to it from our first node, which has the name "start".
We can create a third element similarly:

```java
start.next.next = new Node();
start.next.next.value = -1425.21;
```

![alt text](images/tikz/heap3.svg?style=tikz "")


Chaining ".next.next.next" references is a bit tedious.
We can loop and add several new nodes, by using a reference node called `current`:

```java
Node current = start.next.next;

// add some elements at the end
for (int i = 4; i < 10; i++) {
    current.next = new Node();
    current.next.value = (double) i;
    current = current.next;
}
```

Visually, this looks like:

![alt text](images/tikz/heap4.svg?style=tikz "")

`current` is a convenient reference that can point to any node along the chain that we'd like, instead of moving around and referring to nodes via `.next.next.next[...]`.


As long as each node in this chain has a reference pointing to it, it will persist in memory.
Compared to an array, adding an element to a specific location is easy, but you do need to navigate to it in the chain of references (our linked structure) first:

```java
// add an element at the 3rd position
current = start;
for (int i = 0; i < 3 - 1; i++) {
    current = current.next;
}
// add the element
Node z = new Node();
z.next = current.next;
current.next = z;
```

Like any data structure, we can print every value by visiting each node from start to end

```java
// loop over entire structure
current = start;
while (current != null) {
    System.out.println(current.value);
    current = current.next;
}
```

Just as we can add elements to a specific place, we can delete one too

```java
// delete 4th element
current = start;
for (int i = 0; i < 4 - 1; i++) {
    current = current.next;
}
// get rid of element
current.next = current.next.next;
```

This may be the trickiest thing to get when it comes to linked data structures in a language with automatic memory management ("garbage collection"): deleting or removing an element from a linked data structure like this is performed by removing any and all references to it from other objects. Once we achieve that, the GC process will delete it for us from heap memory.

For a visual example, if we were to delete the third element from the graph shown above, it would look like:

![alt text](images/tikz/heap5.svg?style=tikz "")

Here the third node and it's data have becomed "orphaned", in that no other object points to them. The GC will then free the memory that they occupy.

Since we see that we can pretty easily, create, read, update and delete elements from a reference and node based structure like this, we can wrap up these operations into methods on a class, to let us make something that legitimately operates like a list.

Before we do that, we can use generics to generalize our node class to accept any data type:

```java
class Node<T> {
    public T value;
    public Node<T> next;
}
```

This change isn't major, we can create nodes very much like we did before, we just need to specify what they will contain:

```java
Node<Double> myNode = new Node<Double>();
myNode.data = 0.42

Node<String> anotherNode = new Node<String>();
anotherNode.data = "hello world";
```

This will make it pretty convenient to make a string list, or int list, etc.

Now we can then proceed to build a linked data structure that actually works like a list, what is typically called a "Singularly Linked List". That is, we can have it extend the exact same IList inteface that we created for our dynamic array list.

To keep things simple, we'll focus on making a linked list of a single type, strings. You'll generalize it with generics to all types in the homework.

The class, which we'll write piece by piece in the lecture looks like:

```java
public class StringLinkedList  implements IList<String> {

    private Node<String> start;
    private Node<String> end;

    private int length = 0;


    public static void main(String[] args) {

        StringLinkedList data = new StringLinkedList();

        // a bit of testing

        data.add("hello");
        data.add("world");
        data.add("abc");
        data.add("deg");
        data.add("hgd");
        data.add("okay");
        System.out.println("");
        data.log();
        System.out.println("");
        data.remove(5);
        data.log();
        System.out.println("");
        data.add("working?", 2);
        data.log();

    }

    @Override
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        if (start == null) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public void add(String value) {
        Node<String> newguy = new Node<String>();
        newguy.data = value;

        if (isEmpty()) {
            start = newguy;
            end = newguy;
        }
        else {
            end.next = newguy;
            end = newguy;
        }
        length++;
    }

    public void add(String value, int index) {
        if (index == 0) {
            add(value);
            return;
        }

        Node<String> target = getNode(index - 1);

        Node<String> newguy = new Node<>();
        newguy.data = value;

        newguy.next = target.next;
        target.next = newguy;

        length++;
    }

    public Node<String> getNode(int index) {
        Node<String> current = start;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            current = current.next;

            if (current == null) {
                throw new RuntimeException("List index " + Integer.toString(index)+ " does not exist!");
            }

        }
        return current;
    }

    public int size() {
        return length;
    }

    @Override
    public String get(int index) {
        Node<String> target = getNode(index);
        return target.data;
    }

    @Override
    public void set(String value, int index) {
        Node<String> target = getNode(index);
        target.data = value;
    }

    public void log() {
        Node<String>current = start;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.println(current.data);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void remove(int index) {
        if (index == 0) {
            start = start.next;
        }
        else if (index >= length) {
            throw new RuntimeException("List index " + Integer.toString(index)+ " does not exist!");
        }
        else {
            Node<String> target = getNode(index - 1);
            target.next = target.next.next;
        }
        length+= -1;
    }
}
```
## Complexity of linked list operations

Considering the behavior of each of the operations that we implemented, we can classify them by their complexity.

#### Access

- $\mathcal{O}(n)$: We need to follow references to reach any position.

#### Search

- $\mathcal{O}(n)$: we need to follow references to locate a value.

#### Insertion

- At the start or end: $\mathcal{O}(1)$ : We have direct references to the start and end.

- At a specific position: $\mathcal{O}(n)$: We need to follow references to reach any position.

#### Deletion

- From the start or end: $\mathcal{O}(1)$: We have direct references to the start and end.

- From a specific position: $\mathcal{O}(n)$: We need to follow references to reach any position.

## Java's built-in implementation, *LinkedList*

From an interface perspective, `LinkedList` is used the exact same way as `ArrayList`:

```java
List data = new LinkedList<>();

data.add(0.52);
data.add(-1032.34);
data.remove(0); // remove first element

for (double value : data) {
    System.out.println(value);
}
```
